he program above demonstrates a simple approach for summarizing research papers. It uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from a PDF file, cleans the text using regular expressions and NLTK library, and then summarizes the text using the Gensim summarization library. The output summary can be saved to a file for further use. The approach used in this program can be further optimized and customized based on the specific requirements of the research paper and the desired output summary. Overall, the program provides a good starting point for summarizing research papers and can be further developed and expanded to create more advanced applications.
