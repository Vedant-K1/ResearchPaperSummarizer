This project entails the task of text summarization of research papers in the healthcare
A paper titled Telemedicine and health policy A systematic review
The paper Telemedicine and Health Policy A Systematic Review reviews the current state
of telemedicine and its impact on health policy The authors conducted a systematic review
health policy The authors found that telemedicine has become increasingly prevalent in
health care systems The authors also found that telemedicine has the potential to improve
adoption including regulatory barriers lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services and
limited access to technology in certain populations The authors recommend that health
policy makers take steps to address these barriers including providing reimbursement fortelemedicine services improving access to technology and ensuring that telemedicine

systems and developing training programs for health care providers to deliver telemedicine
