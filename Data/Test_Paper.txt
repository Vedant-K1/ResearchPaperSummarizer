1. Introduction
Machine learning is rapidly gaining inuence in the education industry and can possibly strengthen many important
areas of teaching and learning, research, and decision-making
[1]. It is about mimicking humans in terms of both reasoning
and behaviour [2, 3]. Na¨ıve Bayes, decision tree, and many
other related algorithms have prognostic capabilities that are
of great interest to medical educators and [4] and are being
used to facilitate learning [5]. Machine learning models learn
from experiences or observations and then become very
active to achieve human-like actions [6, 7]. Investigations
have shown that ML has forecasting capabilities by gaining an
understanding of each student’s strengths and weaknesses, as

well as reasons for why they may be struggling in the
classroom [8, 9].
Forecasting of learning outcomes using the machine
learning approach can help educational institutions to
understand the learning patterns and behaviours of their
students, which can be useful in improving school policies, curriculum preparations, and teacher methodology
[10]. Indeed, machine learning algorithms offer opportunities for organizations, including educational institutions to achieve minimal forecast errors (accuracy) and
improve their decision-making process and operational
performances [11]. ML provides improvements that help
reduce forecast mistakes or errors that have been a source
of concerns to many forecasters and their clients in recent
times. +e inaccuracy in forecasting often causes major
problems to systems and could lead to poor decisionmaking and system failure. With machine learning
models that monitor learners’ progress and recommend
next steps have been achieved, and learning analytics are
also made possible to accommodate special learners and
those that require more attention or personalized
teaching. +is study reviews the benefits of ML and its
shortcomings when deployed for academic forecasting.
+e study would go a long way to assist forecasters and
education authorities in understanding the emerging
prospects and challenges of machine learning and how
best to apply it in the education sector to minimize
student’s failures and to enhance the decision-making
process. +is investigation adds to the body of information about the educational applications of machine
learning and artificial intelligence.
2. Related Literature
Several researchers [7, 10, 12–19] have highlighted the
growing application and usefulness of machine learning as a
tool for forecasting of events in the academic sector. Similarly, a study by Elhaj et al. [13] proved the exactness of the
KNN algorithm in detecting the student’s learning style,
which is fast becoming helpful in training at-risk students.
Halde [20] gave analysis of various ways in which machine learning can be applied by educational institutions to
predict students’ performance and the critical characteristics
that have to be considered while making such predictions.
+e researcher discovered that ML enhances more precise
and accurate prediction of academic performances, but
features such as learning styles, motivation, and many other
factors relating to students’ learning have to be considered to
achieve accuracy. Essinger and Rosen [21] presented a
system to aid students’ motivation and interests in problem
solving using machine learning.
Dhanabal and Chandramathi [22] and Itoh et al. [23]
developed a model based on the machine learning algorithm with the capacity to accurately forecast students’
academic outputs based on their historical or previous
record of performances. +ey achieved success in the
study as students’ academic standings were predicted,
thereby enabling those at risk to receive some help that
enhanced their performances. Research on ML is fast
growing, but there are gaps in the literature regarding its
prospects and challenges in academic forecasting in recent times as most existing studies seemed to have been
conducted years ago. +us, this study provides updated
knowledge in this regard. +e summary of the review is
illustrated in Table 1.
3. Overview of Machine Learning
Machine learning is about training machines to learn
certain behaviours or traits and then think and make decisions based on the learned behaviour. It remains one of
the promising areas of research to solve many societal
problems and can be classified as supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. +rough the use of an unsupervised method, you may see if a system can derive data
and inferences even when there are not any results or
training data. While in the supervised learning field, for
each observation of the predictor xi, i � 1, . . ., n there is a
related outcome yi [7]. Supervised algorithms facilitate the
understanding of the learning history of the system and the
correctness of the output for future analysis. Machine
learning can be applied in different areas, including DNA
sequence classification, image processing such as face detection, speech recognition aka natural language processing, security, search engine algorithms, and academic
forecasting [34, 35].
According to trueinteraction.com [36] and Edeh et al.
[37], predictions based on machine learning can be reliable if the dataset is properly trained and the validation
of the model is right. Indeed, the prospects of ML are
huge, and as the education industry embraces new realities, ML together with other emerging technologies
could play a bigger role in learning analytics, e-learning,
students’ examinations and performance prediction and
tracking of teaching, and learning progress. Several
machine learning algorithms such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and CART regression trees (CART) have
different potentials which are of great interest to stakeholders in the academic sector. For machine learning to
be able to understand a dataset, it has to be trained and
also pass through different processes to fully comprehend
such data and be able to interpret and enhance prediction
or any other expected decisions. +is study looks at the
pros and cons associated with machine learning use in
academic forecasting compared to other forecasting
methods. Consequently, Table 2 highlights the comparison between the machine learning-based forecasting and
the traditional forecasting technique.
+e comparison between traditional and machine
learning forecasting techniques is further explained in
Figures 1 and 2 adopted from the Genpact.com website.
Figure 1 shows the stages applied in the traditional
forecasting technique. While Figure 2 depicts different
stages that forecasting through machine learning goes
through before generating an output. As it can be seen,
Figure 2 contains more robust or rigorous procedures that
actually improve the accuracy of the output that is
