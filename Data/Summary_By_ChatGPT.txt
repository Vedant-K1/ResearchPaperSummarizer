The authors review the existing literature on the topic, focusing on studies that have examined the effects of mindfulness on pain-related symptoms, psychological distress, and quality of life. They discuss the various components of mindfulness-based interventions, including body awareness, acceptance, and self-compassion. The authors conclude that mindfulness-based interventions can be beneficial for individuals with chronic pain, as they can help to reduce pain-related symptoms, psychological distress, and improve quality of life. Additionally, the authors suggest that further research is needed to better understand the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on chronic pain.
